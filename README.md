# 🎬 Netflix Originals Data Analysis using SQL

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my project where I dive deep into Netflix Originals data using pure SQL power! If you've ever wondered what kind of shows Netflix produces, which languages dominate, or which genres get the highest ratings — this project is all about uncovering those insights.

## 🧠 What’s This Project About?

Netflix has a huge library of original content, and in this project, I used SQL to explore:

- 📊 Which genres are most popular?
- 🎥 What’s the average runtime of shows?
- ⭐ How do IMDb scores vary across languages and genres?
- 📅 When were most Originals released?

Think of it as a behind-the-scenes look at Netflix’s content strategy using data!

## 🎯 What I Did (In Simple Terms)

I wrote SQL queries to answer interesting questions like:

- 🔝 Which shows have the best ratings and longest runtimes?
- 🌍 How many shows are made in different languages?
- 🕵️‍♂️ Are there any hidden gems with “House” in the title?
- 📆 Which years were most active in content release?
- 💬 What’s the trend in Hindi, English, and Spanish content?

And more! (10 queries in total, covering real-world business-style questions)
